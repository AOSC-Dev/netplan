Description: YAML network configuration abstraction for various backends
 netplan reads network configuration from /etc/nplan/*.yaml which are written
 by administrators, installers, cloud image instantiations, or other OS
 deployments. During early boot it then generates backend specific
 configuration files in /run to hand off control of devices to a particular
 networking daemon.
 .
 Currently supported backends are networkd and NetworkManager.
