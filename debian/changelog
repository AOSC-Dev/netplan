  * Add "netplan ifupdown-migrate" command.
    This supports converting "loopback" (no-op) and "dhcp" interfaces (without
    options) for now.
  * Add "dhcp6:" option
  * Add "gateway[46]:" options
  * Ship empty /etc/netplan in the package
  * NM: Explicitly disable implied DHCP default when DHCP is not enabled.
    (LP: #1617051)
  * tests/integration.py: Quiesce systemd-networkd-wait-online.
  * Add support for VLAN.

  * tests/integration.py: Improve debug messages on failure
  * netplan apply: disconnect devices from NetworkManager before restarting.
    Merely restarting NetworkManager does not suffice to apply a changed
    configuration, so disconnect managed devices first.
    Add autopkgtest to reproduce the problem and confirm the fix.
  * Fix configuration path in package description
  * networkd: Change generated config file prefix to "10-netplan"
    Just "netplan-*" sorts after /lib/systemd/network/99-default.link.
  * netplan apply: Force-replug network devices which are down to apply renames.
    Unbind/rebind network devices from their driver to simulate a hotplug, so
    that device renames get applied. Don't do this for devices which are up
    (or "unknown") though, to avoid disrupting existing network connections.
  * tests/integration.py: Add workaround for NM "unmanaged-devices="
    mishandling (LP #1615044)

  * tests/cli.py: Test "generate" more precisely
  * Let "make coverage" fail if coverage is < 100%
  * Support /run/netplan/*.yaml files.
    This is useful if you want to try out a new network config before
    "committing" it to /etc: if your remote server is still reachable after
    "apply", you copy the files to /etc; otherwise rebooting will go back to
    the known-good state.
  * If global renderer is set to NM, allow NM to manage all devices.
    By default, NetworkManager only manages wifi and wwan devices (via
    /usr/lib/NetworkManager/conf.d/10-globally-managed-devices.conf). If
    global renderer is set to NetworkManager, disable that file in /run so
    that NM will once again manage all devices. This should be configured on
    desktop systems.
  * netplan apply: Asynchronously restart networkd/NM.
    This avoids deadlocks when calling "apply" during the boot sequence.

  * Enable systemd-networkd-wait-online when starting networkd (LP: #1613548)
  * networkd: Prefix generated files with "netplan-"
  * generate: Clean up obsolete generated configs (LP: #1608223)
  * Prefer pycodestyle over pep8

    (partially) for now.
  * tests/integration.py: Use systemd-networkd-wait-online instead of polling
  * netplan.5: Add missing NAME section
